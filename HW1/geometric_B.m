%% Problem 5 Part B

%{
[5 points] For what values of r does the limit limn→∞ Sn exist? What is the limiting
value?
%}

%{

Case 1: 
For r > 1, n -> inf

Sn = (a*(1-r^inf))/(1-r); 

the limit does not exist 

Case 2:
For r = 1, n -> inf

Sn = (a*(1-1^inf))/(1-1);

undefined

Case 3:
For r < 1, n -> inf
ex: -2
Sn = (a*(1-(-2)^inf))/(1-(-2));

limit does not exist

Case 4:
For 0 <= r < 1, n -> inf

ex: .5
Sn = (a*(1-(.5)^inf))/(1-(.5));
(.5)^inf --> 0

Sn = (a)/(1-(.5));

ex: r=0

Sn = a

Limit exists when  0 <= r < 1
